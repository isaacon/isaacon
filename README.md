  <h2>🤓<b>My experience</b>🤓</h2>
  <p>
    I've been 3 years in the programming world, I'm not the best obviously as there are always things to learn, but I've taken Python courses, with this getting to understand frameworks like <b>Flask, Django, Jinja, SQLAlchemy, PySide and Postgres</b>. I also have a lot of experience with <b>LUAU/LUA</b>, and I'm currently starting to study full-stack web development, so you can say I'm intermediate, but I know I still have a lot to learn.
